My question was whether the same applies to science, or if we might fall into the trap of unfairly favoring science. The notion of 'greatness' lacks clear ontological meaning, unless we are referring to sheer size. This applies to other attributes commonly associated with God as well, such as supreme goodness, ultimate truth, perfectness, and omniscience.

I mean if you say that you make genuine Italian food and you don't you are attacking the idea of genuine Italian food by passing the crap that you are making as the real deal. Italians do have the right to be upset there. Same idea goes when we take rich cultures and turn them into mascots.  We take ceremonial garb of people we conquered and turn it into a costume. It isn't a costume. It is a sacred headdress. So if a non Italian makes Italian food, but they make the good stuff and uphold Italian cooking traditions than they should be fine.

If someone claims to make genuine Italian food but fails to deliver, it undermines the concept of actual Italian cuisine. It's understandable that Italians would be upset in such cases. The same principle applies to appropriating rich cultures as mascots. When we take sacred ceremonial attire from conquered people and treat it as a costume, it diminishes its significance. However, if a non-Italian person respects Italian cooking traditions and produces quality food, they should be accepted.

On the other hand, marshmallows tend to float on top until they fully melt, which can be time-consuming and result in lukewarm hot chocolate at best.

Making sure both partners have an equal opportunity to explore their desires and maintain a healthy relationship is vital.

From what we know (from leaks, etc) the Disposition Matrix is largely comprised of known members of foreign terrorist organizations. But the tricky thing is that some of said terrorists are U.S. citizens, and droning them is technically the U.S. government executing one of its own citizens without trial. Anwar al-Awlaki is probably the most well-known American killed this way. Multiple intelligence agencies believe he was the operational leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, so you can kinda see why we did what we did, but... the guy was born in New Mexico, and thus as an American he had a constitutional right to due process which wasn't honored in his killing by drone strike.|changemyview|It appears to me that he is mentioning the CIA's Disposition Matrix, which is a list used for potential drone targeting.

However, the NFL does not appear to prioritize the promotion of free speech. It seems their concern is avoiding alienating conservative viewers to protect their revenue.

Throughout my career, I've been involved in around 70 trials. In cases where someone admits to a violent crime and their confession is not suppressed, the chances of acquittal are extremely low. If your client confides in you, it falls under attorney-client privilege, which means you cannot disclose it (although you cannot allow your client to testify falsely either). As a lawyer, it is not your role to determine the facts of the case. Your responsibility is to defend your client and uphold the constitution. Forgetting this would undermine the justice system.

Noise cancellation is different and does well with these low notes since they're predictable. I'd say it's still enough. I've used them on a plane and the noise that did leak through was tolerable. Having to pop my ears was more annoying.Noise isolation is passively blocking sound while cancellation plays an inverse sound wave compared to the outside noise it picks up with its mic. The two waves cancel each other. Think like two ocean waves where the peak of one is at the trough of the other, both being the same distance from 0.

Noise cancellation, on the other hand, is specifically designed to tackle these low notes as they are predictable. Overall, I found the M50x's noise isolation to be sufficient when using it on a plane, with only a tolerable amount of noise leakage. The only minor annoyance was having to pop my ears. It's important to note that noise isolation passively blocks sound, while noise cancellation uses an inverse sound wave to cancel out external noise picked up by its microphone.

The MEPS doctors gave me a rating of 3 in my PULHES. My recruiter mentioned that if the waiver only brings it down to a 2, I might not be able to pursue my preferred occupations (11B, 13F). Is it typical for a waiver to not result in a score of 1? If I do end up with a 2, is there any possibility of still entering one of the MOSs I desire?

The rating can be misleading, as Fallen has had more wins due to being in a stronger team, while k0nfig has faced more losses in a weaker team, resulting in a lower rating. However, k0nfig excels as a pure entry compared to Fallen. Fallens opening kill stats may be better due to his role as an AWPer, which tends to have higher opening kill stats. It's also important to consider that Fallen has the advantage of playing in the top-ranked team with two top 5 players, making it easier for him to be more consistent compared to k0nfig, who plays in North and has a more aggressive playstyle.|0.43475235|0.091913216|0.9335960149765015

He is playing in a team with 4 incredible players. His role isn't to get loads of kills or anything. His role is to lead and get his insane superstars into favorable positions.

Winning matches depends on the overall performance of the entire team. Even if a player is highly skilled, they can still lose more matches if their team isn't performing well.

Definitely learn to deflect his jumping slam and the follow up mikiri counter on his charged stab. In the final stage mikiri his diving stab to get easy hits early and use it to fill up his posture for the final blow. Then lose your shit when u finally get that final blow. |Sekiro|Try utilizing deflections to weaken the opponent, ensuring you maintain a strategic advantage. Once their health is around two-thirds depleted, focusing on deflections will significantly impact their posture. Remain close to them and attack sparingly to encourage their aggression while also allowing you to land decisive deflections for victory. It is crucial to develop a mastery of deflecting their jumping slam and the subsequent counter to their charged stab. During the final stage, capitalize on opportunities to perform a Mikiri counter on their diving stab, granting you easy hits and facilitating the buildup of their posture.

Imagining someone advocating for this law, using sources and statistics to emphasize its potential benefits in preventing disease and unwanted children. However, the discomfort caused by people not wearing pants would understandably lead to resistance, despite the advantages. When we translate this situation to the concept of abortions, the discomfort and opposition are even more intense due to the values at stake.

I agree as a lifelong female resident of Texas there is a lot of extreme religious BS used to justify misogyny here, but I think it's a formula of more unwanted babies + more poverty + less likelihood of education = more fearful, unhappy, male *and* female population which = easier to control. Party, religion, state doesn't really matter except for where it makes it easier to implement the wanted outcome, IMO...it's all about the wealthy getting more money/power and more easier to control 'slaves'.Am I a crazy conspiracist?

As a long-time female resident of Texas, I've noticed how certain extreme religious beliefs are used to justify sexism. However, I believe the underlying factors of increased poverty, limited education opportunities, and a higher number of unwanted pregnancies contribute to a fearful and unhappy population, both male and female. This ultimately creates an environment where manipulation is easier. Regardless of political party, religion, or state, the main goal seems to be gaining power and wealth for the already privileged.
