As my last year of college approaches, my family and I have a lovely tradition of going out for dinner, watching a movie, and celebrating the New Year by watching the ball drop in Times Square on TV.

This yearly tradition holds a special place in my heart, as it brings our family together. However, knowing that my sister and I will be moving out soon, this New Year's celebration may mark the end of this cherished tradition.
